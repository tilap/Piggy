# Developper Folder

This folder is for development only. It provides some stuff I don't know where to put.

## GIT-HOOKS

I put some usefull githuk for that project. Usage:

```cp -R ./dev/git-hooks/* ./git/hooks/```

## MODULES TEMPLATES

The files in that folders are twig templates to generate modules via gulp.

The `make module` use them to generate new empty basic modules.
