# Piggy

This is a stupid app I'm working on to learn NodeJS, Koa, ES6, and all the node magic.

See [my dev notes](./NOTES.md).

## Running commands:

Type ```make``` to get the full options list. Main important ones are:

```
# Install the package dependancies
make install
make i

# Build the app
make build
make b

# Start and watch the app with automatically reload
make watch
make w

# Clean the generated files
make clean
make c

# Remove all packages folders
make reset
make r
```
